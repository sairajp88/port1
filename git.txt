Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Open your web browser and go to GitHub.
Click on the "Sign up" button and follow the prompts to create your account.
Verify your email address if prompted.
Step 2: Install Git
Download Git for Windows from the official Git website.
Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Git. Make sure to select the appropriate options according to your preferences.
Step 3: Configure Git
Open the command prompt (search for "cmd" and press Enter).
Set your username by typing:
arduino
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
Set your email address by typing:
arduino
Copy code
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
Replace "Your GitHub Username" with your GitHub username and "your_email@example.com" with the email associated with your GitHub account.
Step 4: Create a New Repository on GitHub
Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
Give your repository a name, a description (optional), and choose whether it should be public or private.
Click on the "Create repository" button.
Step 5: Initialize Git Repository Locally
Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project using the command prompt.
Initialize a new Git repository by typing:
csharp
Copy code
git init
Step 6: Add and Commit Your Files
Add your files to the repository by typing:
csharp
Copy code
git add .
This command adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.
Commit the changes by typing:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Replace "Initial commit" with a brief description of your changes.
Step 7: Link Local Repository to GitHub Repository
Copy the URL of your GitHub repository.
Link your local repository to the GitHub repository by typing:
csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.
Step 8: Push Your Code to GitHub
Push your code to GitHub by typing:
perl
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command pushes your committed changes to the master branch of your GitHub repository.
Step 9: Verify on GitHub
Refresh your GitHub repository page in your web browser.
You should see your files and folders from your local repository now on GitHub.
That's it! You've successfully created a version control account on GitHub, created a repository, and pushed your code using Git commands.
